        <div><bold>Hi there</bold>-my name is Sneha, and this is my about me page!</div>
        <div> I was born and raised in the Tampa Bay Area, and am currently finishing my 
            senior year at Wharton where I'm majoring in Business Analytics and minoring 
            in Computer Science. On campus, I write data stories for the Daily 
            Pennsylvanian, TA for a computer science class on campus, and am the website 
            manager for the WQHS radio station. If you can't find me at one of those 
            things, I'm probably out on a run or getting boba.</div>
